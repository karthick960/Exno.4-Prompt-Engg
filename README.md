### REGISTER NUMBER : 212222040070
### Aim: 
Scenario-Based Report Development Utilizing Diverse Prompting Techniques
### Algorithm:  
The goal of this experiment is to design and develop an AI-powered chatbot that can handle customer inquiries, provide support, and improve customer experience in a retail environment. Create prompts using various AI prompting techniques to guide your experiment, data collection, analysis, and report creation

### Prompting Techniques by Stage
#### 1. Experiment Design
#### Broad/Naïve Prompting:

“What services should a retail chatbot offer?”

#### Specific Prompting:

“Name 5 customer support features for an e-commerce chatbot.”

#### Scenario-Based Prompting:

“Imagine a customer looking for a late delivery update. How should the chatbot respond?”

#### 2. Data Collection
#### Role Prompting:

“You are a frustrated customer—ask about your order.”

#### Few-Shot Prompting:

Provide short back-and-forth sample conversations for data synthesis.

#### Survey Prompts:

“Rate your experience from 1-10.”

#### Follow-Up Prompts:

“If the chatbot didn’t help, what went wrong?”

#### 3. Model Training
Instruction Prompting:

“Classify queries into: Order Status, Product Info, Complaints.”

#### Chain-of-Thought Prompting:

Step-by-step handling of complaints (e.g., ask for ID, check eligibility, respond).

#### Zero-Shot Prompting:

Classify unseen queries without examples to test generalization.

#### 4. Evaluation & Analysis
Reflexive Prompting:

Ask the AI to critique its own response and offer a better one.

#### Comparative Prompting:

“Compare chatbot accuracy before and after fine-tuning.”

#### Data Synthesis Prompts:

“List top features users requested.”

#### 5. Report Creation
#### Persona Prompting:

“Explain performance findings to retail managers in simple terms.”

#### Summary Prompting:

“Summarize key issues users faced with the chatbot.”

#### Recommendation Prompting:

“Based on feedback, suggest 3 improvements.”
